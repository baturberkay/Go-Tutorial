## Tests

Before writing a test, some important points should be noted. <br/>
* Test files must end with "_test" suffix. <br/>
* You may want to see the result of each test, you need to add -v tag to the command. -v means verbose mode which prints test results to the console.

To run the tests, the command should be <br/>
````
go test test_file_test.go -v
````
